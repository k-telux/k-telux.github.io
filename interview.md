### Research proposal
Fiber cavities offer significant advantages for handling materials compared to 2D integrated cavities or traditional Fabry-Perot cavities. They provide high flexibility with adjustable cavity lengths, allowing precise alignment to target specific regions, such as single defects in 2D materials. Their non-destructive nature protects delicate samples and supports repeatable measurements. Fiber cavities also achieve high quality factors and small mode volumes, enhancing light-matter interactions for quantum applications. Additionally, they are versatile, integrating easily into complex experimental setups like cryogenic or high-field environments, while requiring simpler fabrication processes. Overall, their adaptability and efficiency make them ideal for optical characterization and quantum studies in 2D materials.

### difficulty in research/ research experience
While working on a project that required polyimide-coated optical fibers for a vacuum system, I faced difficulties manually coating the fibers. The hand-operated method resulted in inconsistent coating due to unstable speed and inadequate temperature control. To address this, I designed a custom setup with two fiber clamps to hold the fibers in place and a motorized hole with polyimide to ensure stable movement through the fiber. I also integrated a PTC heater to maintain a consistent temperature for better coating adhesion and made the coating temperature and velocity both adjustable to find the best parameters for a specific coating thickness. This innovation significantly improved both the coating process's efficiency and the fibers' quality. With this equipment, we quickly finished the project, and the automatic coating system became a patent for my mentor.

### PhD need for work?
In my opinion, the most important characteristics a PhD student should have are strong collaboration and communication skills. While technical expertise and independent thinking are critical, research today is inherently interdisciplinary and collaborative. No matter how brilliant an idea may be, its true potential can only be realized through effective teamwork and the ability to communicate concepts clearly and persuasively.

As someone who has worked in diverse research settings—ranging from fabricating quantum emitters in 2D materials to building optical systems for single-atom trapping—I have experienced firsthand the value of collaboration. For example, during my research at Rice University, I worked closely with experts from different fields to optimize single-photon emitter purity, a task that required integrating knowledge from nanofabrication, spectroscopy, and quantum physics. It was our ability to share insights and ideas effectively that drove the project forward.

Equally important is the skill of communicating complex ideas to a broader audience, whether it’s within a research group, at conferences, or in publications. These interactions not only advance science but also inspire new perspectives and ideas. By fostering collaboration and open communication, a PhD student can contribute to a vibrant research community and build bridges across disciplines.

I believe that these skills are not just helpful but essential for addressing the complex challenges we face in modern research, and I strive to embody them in every project I undertake.

### Why choose Sinapore, why choose NUS?
One of the key reasons I chose to apply to CUHK is the opportunity to work in Prof. Xinwei Li’s lab. His group’s pioneering research in using laser-based ultrafast optical techniques to investigate emergent quantum electronic orders in solids attracts me a lot. I am particularly inspired by his innovative work in exploring nanoscale optomechanical interactions and developing high-precision photonic systems, which resonates with my aspiration to advance quantum materials and photonic technologies.

NUS physics department have a number of first-rate laboratories likeSurface Science Laboratory,the Laser Spectroscopy Laboratory and the Image & Signal Processing Laboratory. And has a well-equipped workshop to support the research activities, and three Computer and Applications Laboratories with 200 high-power workstations and PCs.

### After PhD graduation?
Ultimately, my goal is to become a faculty member, inspiring and mentoring the next generation of scientists while leading a vibrant research community. I aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge advancements in quantum optics and innovative teaching practices.

In my future research, I hope to explore the quantum properties of two-dimensional materials and their integration into photonic systems, such as cavity QED setups. My focus will be on developing nanoscale platforms that allow precise control of quantum phenomena, enabling breakthroughs in areas like quantum sensing and secure communications. Additionally, I am passionate about translating these discoveries into tools that can probe and manipulate quantum states at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions.

By fostering an environment where curiosity drives creativity, I aspire to contribute meaningfully to the scientific world while empowering the next generation to explore and innovate in this fascinating field.



### Why choose HK, CUHK?
One of the key reasons I chose to apply to CUHK is the opportunity to work with Prof. Sun Xiankai’s lab. His group’s pioneering research in optomechanics, quantum photonics, and integrated photonic devices aligns seamlessly with my academic background and research interests. I am particularly inspired by his innovative work in exploring nanoscale optomechanical interactions and developing high-precision photonic systems, which resonates with my aspiration to advance quantum materials and photonic technologies.

CUHK’s interdisciplinary environment and its strong emphasis on fostering innovation and collaboration make it an ideal place for my PhD journey. I am confident that the resources and academic culture at CUHK will enable me to grow as a researcher while contributing to the university’s ongoing advancements in quantum science.
### Why EE?
I chose to pursue Electrical Engineering because it offers a unique balance between foundational science and practical applications. EE provides the tools and methodologies to translate groundbreaking concepts in quantum optics and photonics into real-world technologies. 
Choosing EE at CUHK is, therefore, a deliberate step to align my skills and passions with a field that empowers me to turn scientific insights into impactful innovations.
