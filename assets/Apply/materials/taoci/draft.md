## Slide 3: Personal Introduction

Let me begin with a brief introduction about myself. I will completed my undergraduate studies in Optics and Optical Engineering next year, with a GPA of 87 out of 100. My academic journey has been strengthened by rigorous coursework in Quantum Mechanics, Advanced Photonics, and Engineering Optics, in which I consistently performed well. These courses have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum optics. 
My primary research interests include cavity QED, quantum memory based on cold atoms, and the optical characteristics of two-dimensional materials, especially transition metal dichalcogenides.

## Slide 4: Resume and Honors

“Throughout my academic journey, I have received several honors and awards, including the Outstanding Student Scholarship and the Endeavor Scholarship, which placed me in the top 5% of my cohort. I also had the opportunity to participate in the Chung-Yao Chao Talent Program, a highly selective scholarship program.

I have co-authored a paper titled *Approaching the Intrinsic Purity of Single-Photon Emitters in Atomically Thin Semiconductors*, however the paper now is still undereview, we submit it to ACS Nano. Additionally, I have gained valuable teaching experience as a Teaching Assistant for the Optics B course in Fall 2023, under the supervision of Professor Zheng Xi. This role involved supporting a class of 58 junior students, contributing to their understanding of optics concepts.

Finally, my Skills in programming languages include Python, C/C++, and HTML/CSS. I am proficient in various frameworks and software tools such as Anaconda, MATLAB, Solidworks, LabVIEW, Keil, and COMSOL, which are critical for conducting simulations, data analysis, and experimental setups in my research work.

Overall, these experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical applications, preparing me to contribute meaningfully to the research group and academic community

## Slide 5-6: Research Experience

In terms of research, I have had the privilege of working in two major areas. First, I was involved in single-atom trapping using movable optical lattices, where I successfully demonstrated high-precision atomic position control through fluorescence detection. Additionally, I explored combining cavity cooling with feedback cooling to push temperature limits, verifying this through theoretical calculations.
More recently, I have been working on single-photon emitters in atomically thin semiconductors, specifically WSe2. In this project, I conducted polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements and time-correlated single-photon counting to improve the understanding of defect-bound excitonic emissions. This research is critical to improving the purity and reliability of single-photon sources, which are key to the development of quantum light technologies.

## Slide 7: Project 1: Single Atom Trapping

“One of the key outcomes of this project was the successful design and implementation of control circuits and electronics for microwave amplifiers and radio frequency generators. This allowed us to optimize mode matching between the cavity and fiber. The vacuum system we built achieved a degree of 3×10−11 Torr, which was crucial for ensuring the stability of the system.

In this project, we also explored new methods to improve cooling by combining cavity cooling and feedback cooling, achieving lower temperatures by solving the master equation and stochastic Schrödinger equation.”

## Slide 8-9: Project 2: Single-Photon Emission in 2D Materials

“My second major research project focused on creating single-photon emitters in two-dimensional materials, specifically transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Under Prof. Shengxi Huang’s supervision at SCOPE Lab, I worked on introducing effective techniques to mitigate broad defect-bound excitonic emission in WSe2, aiming to reveal the intrinsic purity limit of single-photon emitters.

We employed polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements and various g² measurement techniques to systematically investigate the purity of single-photon emitters in monolayer and bilayer WSe2. We found that cross-circular polarization can effectively reduce background emissions and significantly improve the purity of single-photon emission.”

## Slide 10: Project Results and Challenges

“While we observed promising results, such as ultra-sharp and bright emissions at cryogenic temperatures, several challenges remain. The presence of broad classical emissions overlapping with the single-photon wavelength reduces the purity of the emitter, which is a significant hurdle in using these materials for quantum information processes. Nevertheless, we made important strides in characterizing the optical behavior of 2D materials and designing advanced substrates with strain engineering features.”

## Slide 11: Future Research Plan
In the context of this lab, my primary research objective is to apply my background in quantum optics to advance two-photon fluorescence microscopy, particularly for in vivo neurovascular studies. One specific direction is to develop ultrafast fluorescence imaging techniques, which could capture data more rapidly and with higher precision than current methods. The goal is to extend the imaging capacity beyond conventional limits, allowing us to better track dynamic processes, such as blood flow, with unprecedented speed and resolution.

Additionally, I am excited to explore the integration of AI-driven data analysis techniques to improve label-free imaging and fluorescence microscopy. By developing or enhancing computational algorithms, such as matrix factorization for fluorescence data, my aim is to improve the detection and interpretation of neural activity and vascular structures, allowing for more accurate and efficient data processing. This work would contribute to the lab's focus on multimodal imaging while pushing the boundaries of what current imaging technologies can achieve in both clinical and basic neuroscience contexts.
