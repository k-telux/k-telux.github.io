## Slide 2: Outline

“Here is the outline of my presentation. First, I will introduce myself briefly. Then, I will delve into my research experience and results, highlighting key projects I have worked on. Finally, I will conclude with my doctoral research plan and the directions I would like to pursue during my PhD.”

---

## Slide 3: Personal Introduction

“Let me begin with a brief introduction about myself. My name is Zhongqi Xiu, and I graduated with a degree in Optics and Optical Engineering, achieving a GPA of 87/100. I have also completed courses that are highly relevant to my research interests, such as Quantum Mechanics, Advanced Photon Physics, and Engineering Optics, all of which I performed well in. My TOEFL score is 99, indicating my proficiency in English.

My primary research interests include cavity QED, quantum memory based on cold atoms, and the optical characteristics of two-dimensional materials, especially transition metal dichalcogenides.”

---

## Slide 4: Resume and Honors

“Throughout my academic journey, I have received several honors and awards, including the Outstanding Student Scholarship and the Endeavor Scholarship, which placed me in the top 5% of my cohort. I also had the opportunity to participate in the Chung-Yao Chao Talent Program, a highly selective scholarship program.

I have co-authored a publication titled *Approaching the Intrinsic Purity of Single-Photon Emitters in Atomically Thin Semiconductors*, published in *Optics B* in 2023. Additionally, I have worked as a teaching assistant in quantum mechanics and photonics courses, which has sharpened my ability to explain complex topics clearly.”

---

## Slide 5-6: Research Experience

“Moving on to my research experience, I have had the privilege to work on several advanced projects in quantum optics. The first major project I worked on involved single atom trapping using movable optical lattices. This was conducted in the Fiber Cavity QED group under Prof. Chuan-Feng Li at the Key Laboratory of Quantum Information at CAS. We successfully combined fluorescence detection with high-precision control of atomic positions. My responsibilities included leading the construction of our second ultra-high vacuum optical system and mounting Rb atom dispensers for magneto-optical traps.”

---

## Slide 7: Project 1: Single Atom Trapping

“One of the key outcomes of this project was the successful design and implementation of control circuits and electronics for microwave amplifiers and radio frequency generators. This allowed us to optimize mode matching between the cavity and fiber. The vacuum system we built achieved a degree of 3×10−11 Torr, which was crucial for ensuring the stability of the system.

In this project, we also explored new methods to improve cooling by combining cavity cooling and feedback cooling, achieving lower temperatures by solving the master equation and stochastic Schrödinger equation.”

---

## Slide 8-9: Project 2: Single-Photon Emission in 2D Materials

“My second major research project focused on creating single-photon emitters in two-dimensional materials, specifically transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Under Prof. Shengxi Huang’s supervision at SCOPE Lab, I worked on introducing effective techniques to mitigate broad defect-bound excitonic emission in WSe2, aiming to reveal the intrinsic purity limit of single-photon emitters.

We employed polarization-resolved photoluminescence measurements and various g² measurement techniques to systematically investigate the purity of single-photon emitters in monolayer and bilayer WSe2. We found that cross-circular polarization can effectively reduce background emissions and significantly improve the purity of single-photon emission.”

---

## Slide 10: Project Results and Challenges

“While we observed promising results, such as ultra-sharp and bright emissions at cryogenic temperatures, several challenges remain. The presence of broad classical emissions overlapping with the single-photon wavelength reduces the purity of the emitter, which is a significant hurdle in using these materials for quantum information processes. Nevertheless, we made important strides in characterizing the optical behavior of 2D materials and designing advanced substrates with strain engineering features.”

---

## Slide 11: Future Research Plan

“Looking ahead, I am excited about the potential to continue exploring quantum optics, particularly in cavity QED systems and single-photon emitters. During my PhD, I plan to build on my previous research by addressing several key challenges:

1. **Enhancing Single-Photon Emitter Purity**: I plan to develop methods for further improving the purity of single-photon emitters in 2D materials through better strain engineering and defect control.

2. **Integrating Atom-Based Quantum Memory**: I aim to investigate how cavity QED can be integrated with atom-based quantum memories, particularly in systems that combine cold atoms and optical fibers. This work could have a significant impact on quantum information storage and retrieval.

3. **Exploring New Quantum Materials**: I am also interested in exploring new quantum materials and hybrid systems that combine TMDs with other nanostructures to create tunable single-photon sources with high stability and efficiency.”

---

## Slide 12: Conclusion and Questions

“In conclusion, my research background in cavity QED, single-photon emitters, and quantum optics has prepared me to contribute meaningfully to your program. I believe that my skills, combined with the resources and mentorship available in your department, will allow me to tackle cutting-edge challenges in quantum information science. I am eager to contribute to ongoing research while exploring new directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Thank you for your time. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.”
