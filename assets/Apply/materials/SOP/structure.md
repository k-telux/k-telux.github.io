This is the brief structure of the sop:

### para1:Brief intro and the aim/why apply and what you want to do in future/
My long-term goal is to dedicate myself to the research field of _. In order to
achieve this goal, I hope to acquire my Ph.D. at _ starting in the fall
of 2000.
### para2:The process why choose optics (from CS to physics, in freshmen and then get involved)
Unlike those students who love their career starting in childhood, I choose and then fell in love with optics just in my university year(2022 Spring)
* CS TO OPTICS
* Read the book
* Do the exp
* Then visit the SHGY
Although my strengths are concentrated in these areas, my curiosity is by no means limited to these topics. I believe that I have a solid foundation, but through a program of graduate study and research I hope to develop expertise in these and other related areas.   

### para3,4,5:Research exp in optics 
* in Fiber cavity QED(hard process of the optics,learning also the ability to access new things )
* using programme language to do some research 
* then change into 2D(about reparing and using the optical knowledge to do things, also self-motivation)

### para6,7: tell something about the 2D and the APP program
* about the life in Rice, the acadamic atmosphere of Rice APP and Huang's group
* About the life goal and why will be applied
