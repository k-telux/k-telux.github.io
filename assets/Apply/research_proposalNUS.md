# Quantum Property Measurement of 2D Materials in Fiber Cavities

## Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have demonstrated significant potential as quantum emitters and platforms for studying novel quantum phenomena. Their tunable optical and electronic properties make them suitable for quantum technology applications, including secure communication and quantum computing. Integrating these materials with fiber cavities allows for enhanced control over light-matter interactions, enabling nanoscale measurement of quantum properties. This project aims to explore these interactions within fiber cavities to advance the understanding of 2D materials' quantum behavior.

# Research Objective
The aim of this project is to investigate the quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials by integrating them into fiber-based cavities. Using this setup, we will explore light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, particularly focusing on the emission characteristics and coherence of single-photon sources. By coupling 2D materials with fiber cavities, this research seeks to enhance our understanding of their quantum behavior, which is essential for advancing quantum technologies.

## Background and Motivation
Two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), have shown remarkable potential as single-photon sources and as platforms for studying novel quantum phenomena due to their tunable electronic and optical properties. However, their quantum properties at the nanoscale are still not fully understood, especially under the influence of cavity-enhanced photon interactions. Integrating 2D materials into fiber cavities provides a highly controlled environment for probing and manipulating these properties, offering new avenues for practical quantum applications in secure communication, quantum sensing, and computing.

Cavity Fabrication and Integration: High-Q fiber cavities will be fabricated and integrated with the prepared 2D materials. This setup will allow precise control over the photon coupling environment, facilitating a detailed analysis of the materials' quantum emission characteristics.

## Quantum Property Characterization: 
Utilizing photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved spectroscopy, we will characterize the emission properties of the 2D materials within the fiber cavities. This step will focus on identifying and enhancing single-photon emission, photon coherence, and quantum yield.
