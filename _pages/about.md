I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from the [School of Physical Sciences](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Optics and Optical Engineering.

Now I'm doing research about single photon emission from WSe2/WS2, which is supported by the [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), led by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and [Dr. Wenjing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lm68m7kAAAAJ) at Rice University.

## Research Interests
- Fiber cavity QED
- Quantum memory based on atoms (Especially _87Rb_ )
- Optical characteristics of 2D materials
- Single photon emission based on defects
