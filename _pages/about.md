I am a fourth-year undergraduate student from the [School of Physical Sciences](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Optics and Optical Engineering.

From 2022 to 2024, I focused on Fiber Cavity QED and participated in the "Single-atom trapping technique based on movable optical lattices" project supervised by [Prof. Chuan-Feng Li](http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/cfli/) and associate professor [Dr. Jian Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wangjian1), [CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information](https://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC

Now, I am researching single photon emission in few-layer WSe2/WS2, which is supported by the [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/) and led by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and [Wenjing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lm68m7kAAAAJ) at Rice University.(Visiting scholar)

My senior thesis will focus on the __strain engineering__ using __PZT array__(Especially PMN-PT). Now I'm trying to simulate the system and make the strain __programmable__ using the voltage modulation.

## Research Interests
- Fiber cavity QED
- Quantum memory based on atoms (Especially _87Rb_ )
- Optical characteristics of 2D materials
- Single photon emission based on defects
