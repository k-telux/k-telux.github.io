I am a first-year graduate student from [the Chemistry PhD program](https://chemistry.brown.edu/graduate) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/). I will join [Yusong Bai's Group](https://www.yusongbai.org/) after the first semester rotation. You can find my academic CV [here](../assets/xzq_Resume.pdf)

## PhD Research Area
- Exciton phase transition in low dimensional materials
- Mott transition and the hidden phase in moire supperlattice
- 2D devices fabrication and stack

I have a bachelor degree of physics at [School of Physical Sciences](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Optics and Optical Engineering.  You can find my bachelor thesis [here](../assets/bachelor_thesis.pdf).

From 2022 to 2024, I focused on Fiber Cavity QED and participated in the "Single-atom trapping technique based on movable optical lattices" project supervised by [Prof. Chuan-Feng Li](http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/cfli/) and associate professor [Dr. Jian Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wangjian1), [CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information](https://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/) at USTC.

At 2024 summer, I went to Rice University for a half year internship program. I invastigated the single photon emission in few-layer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) and finished my bachlor degree thesis, which were supported by the [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/) and led by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and [Wenjing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lm68m7kAAAAJ) at Rice University.

## Bachelor Research History
- Fiber cavity QED with cold atoms
- Single photon emission based on defects
- Strain engineering by piezoelectric materials and neural network
