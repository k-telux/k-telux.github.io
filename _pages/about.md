I'm a fourth-year undergraduate student from the [School of Physical Sciences](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Optics and Optical Engineering.

From 2022 to 2024, I focused on Fiber Cavity QED and participated in the project "Single atom trapping technique based on movable optical lattices", which was supervised by [Prof. Chuan-Feng Li](http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/cfli/) and associate professor [Dr. Jian Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wangjian1), [CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information](https://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/) in USTC_

Now, I am doing research about Single Photon emission in fewlayer WSe2/WS2, which is supported by the [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), led by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and [Dr. Wenjing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lm68m7kAAAAJ) at Rice University.

## Research Interests
- Fiber cavity QED
- Quantum memory based on atoms (Especially _87Rb_ )
- Optical characteristics of 2D materials
- Single photon emission based on defects
