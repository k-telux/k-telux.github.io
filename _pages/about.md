I'm a forth year undergraduate student from [School of Physical Sciences](https://en.physics.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), major in Optics and Optical Engineering. 

Now I'm doing research about single photon emission from WSe2/WS2, which is supported by [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), led by Prof. Shengxi Huang and Dr. Wenjing Wu in Rice University.

My research interests include optical instrument, fiber cavity, quantum optics and optical characters about 2D materials.

You can find my CV here: [Zhongqi Xiu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
