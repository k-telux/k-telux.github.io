## Paper

### _Ultrahigh-Purity Single-Photon Emission from 2D WSe2 via Effective Suppression of Classical Emission_
Wenjing Wu, Alex Strasser, **Zhongqi Xiu**...Shuo Sun, Junichiro Kono, Xiaofeng Qian, Shengxi Huang

## Research Experience

### Single atom trapping technique based on movable optical lattices 
*2022 - 2024*  
This program was proposed to achieve the trapping of single atoms and combine fluorescence detection to achieve high-precision control of atomic positions by movable optical lattice.  
Supervisors: [Dr. Jian Wang](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/wangjian1), [Prof. Chuanfeng Li](http://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/cfli/)  
Lab: [CAS Key Laboratory of Quantum Information](https://lqcc.ustc.edu.cn/)

- Participated in setting up the optical path in a magneto-optical trap for $^{87}Rb$. Independently built the double pass configuration to adjust the frequency of cooling light with Bragg diffraction.
- Led building and testing of our second ultrahigh optical accessible vacuum system, in which we mounted an Rb atom dispenser for the MOT and optical dipole traps for ensembles and single atoms. The vacuum degree of the system has reached $3\times10^{-11}$ Torr.
- Independently pre-treated the optical fiber which will be used in the vacuum system and tested the mode field diameter of treated single mode fiber to optimize the mode matching between the modes of cavity and fiber.
- Independently designed control circuits and installed control electronics such as the microwave amplifier, radio frequency switch, and radio frequency generator into multiple integrated chassis to facilitate the connection of electrical devices in the optical path.
- Achieved the control time of atoms to 3s (Unpublished)

### Single photon emitter creation in few layer 2D materials
*2024*  
Supervisors: [Wenjing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lm68m7kAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang)  
Lab: [SCOPE Lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/)

- Carried out optical spectroscopy measurements including photoluminescence (PL), Raman, Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) on hBN encapsulated WSe2 and WS2 monolayers integrated with strain engineered substrates.
  
- Examined the single photon emission quality by conducting photon statistic measurements, obtain second-order correlation function $g^{2}(\tau) $using Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) interferometry.
