## Discover physical concepts with neural networks (2021-2022)
****
* Independently built neural networks with three neurons using MATLAB. 
* Derived the Planck radiation law formula from original spectrum data using the model. [Reference](../assets/neural_network.pdf)
* Summary of the work (This work got first prize in competition): [Paper](../assets/neural_network_report.pdf)

## Theoretical and experimental research on IYPT 2022 Problem 8 — Equipotential Lines (2022)
****
_Place two electrodes into water, supply a safe voltage and use a voltmeter to determine electric potential at various locations. Investigate how the measured equipotential lines deviate from your expectations for different conditions and liquids._
* Investigated the equipotential lines in pure water and salt water, constructing the influence of electrodes on the potential distribution in water through different models.
  *  According to the comparison of measured data and theoretical fitting models (using COMSOL), the formula analysis of electric double layer capacitance theory, bubble theory, alternating current substitution theory and ion concentration theory is carried out. 
* Summary of the work: [Paper](../assets/equipotential_lines.pdf)

## Simulation and review of light field modes in Fabry–Pérot cavity(2022)
****
* Simulated the transmission characteristics (transmission rate, resonance mode) of Fabry-Perot resonators using COMSOL and compared the results with analytical solutions.
* Summary of the work: [Paper](../assets/FPcavity.pdf) 

## RoboGame 2023 (2023)
****
_RoboGame Robotics Competition is a major brand activity of students' scientific and technological innovation and comprehensive practical education founded by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2001, which requires the participating teams to design and build their own robots to participate in the competition within no more than half a year and with a certain amount of funding, centering on a specific theme and rules of the competition._ 

* [Robotics Budget and Feasibility Plan](../assets/plan.pdf) (Got second prize in 50+ teams)
* As the sole electrical controls engineer on the team, I developed the majority of the control code for the robot's movement and catching mechanisms. Additionally, I designed the main control board using STM32, created the PCB, ensured consistency across all robot components, and fine-tuned the PID for wheel movement.
* Finally we successfully finished the tasks and won third prize in the finals.
* Codes and PCBs in [github repositories](https://github.com/k-telux/RoboGame2023)
