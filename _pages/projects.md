## Discover physical concepts with neural networks (2021-2022)
****
* Independently built neural networks with three neurons using MATLAB. 
* Derived the Planck radiation law formula from original spectrum data using the model. [Reference](../assets/neural_network.pdf)
* Summary of the work (This work got first prize in competition): [Paper](../assets/neural_network_report.pdf)

## Theoretical and experimental research on IYPT 2022 Problem 8 — Equipotential Lines (2022)
****
_Place two electrodes into water, supply a safe voltage and use a voltmeter to determine electric potential at various locations. Investigate how the measured equipotential lines deviate from your expectations for different conditions and liquids._
* Investigated the equipotential lines in pure water and salt water, constructing the influence of electrodes on the potential distribution in water through different models.
  *  According to the comparison of measured data and theoretical fitting models (using COMSOL), the formula analysis of electric double layer capacitance theory, bubble theory, alternating current substitution theory and ion concentration theory is carried out. 
* Summary of the work: [Paper](../assets/equipotential_lines.pdf)

## Simulation and review of light field modes in Fabry–Pérot cavity(2022)
****
* Simulated the transmission characteristics (transmission rate, resonance mode) of Fabry-Perot resonators using COMSOL and compared the results with analytical solutions.
* Summary of the work: [Paper](../assets/FPcavity.pdf)
