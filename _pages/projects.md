## Discovering physical concepts with neural networks (2021-2022)
****
* Independently built neural networks with three neurons using MATLAB. 
* Discovered the Planck radiation law with original spectrum data using the model. [Reference](../assets/neural_network.pdf)
* Brief conclusion of the work. [Paper](../assets/neural_network_report.pdf)
